This program prints two of Bob Neill's Typewriter Art patterns (`Prince
Charles' and `The Tabby Cat') to an Epson FX or LQ compatible dot matrix
printer.  Bob Neill started producing pictures on his typewriter in 1960,
and his pictures and portraits have appeared in various magazines and
journals, including `Woman's Realm', `Jackie', `She' and the `Catholic
Herald'.

How are these patterns created?   In Bob's words, by `copying a photograph
direct on to a blank sheet of paper transposing in my mind, from the
photograph, the varying intensities of shading to the appropriate letters
and punctuation marks, or combinations of same'.

The advantages of using a computer rather than a typewriter to print the
pictures are obvious: once the data has been programmed, one or more
accurate hard copies can be produced in a matter of minutes.

To run the program, make sure that GWBASIC.EXE is on the PATH, and that you
are in the directory containing TYPEART.BAS, then type

      GWBASIC TYPEART

and follow the prompts.

If your printer is not Epson FX or LQ compatible you will need to change
three variables in the GW-Basic program:

RESET.CODE$   resets the printer to its default settings.

ZERO.LFEED$   executes a carriage return without line feed, i.e. moves
              the print head back to the first column (needed for
              overprinting).

NORMAL.LFEED$ executes a line feed with a line spacing that produces
              `square output'.  The line spacing should be such that if ten
              lines of ten letter G's are printed, they produce a square.
